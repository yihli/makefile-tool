# Makefile Tool
A simple tool to generate a makefile for a single executable from a directory of .cpp and .h files. Developed using Bash and C++. Inspired to make this after being introduced to Bash scripting and RegEx in my CS class :smile:

## How to Use
From any terminal that can run bash scripts such as Windows PowerShell or Linux, run the command:

```./makefile-tool.sh <path-to-files>```

Make sure ```makefile-tool.sh``` and ```find_includes``` are located in the current directory of your terminal.
Provide a name for your executable, and then the path to the directory containing your .cpp and .h files. Your Makefile should be generated!

As I am still learning software development, please do not hesitate to leave any suggestions for my code and bring up any issues encountered üëç
